### Catch.js

A dynamic page that toggles between Bug and Fish creatures. Users are able to catch bugs and fish with a cooldown of 1 minute. Users are also able to sell bugs and fishes one at a time or all at once to add to their total value in bells.

### Market.js

A real-time market that displays the price change of turnips over a day. Users are also able to view price changed over the last week and month. Users are also able to buy turnips and sell turnips based on the market price. All transactions are recorded at the bottom.

### Profile.js

Here users are also able to remove CrossingBot from their twitch stream should they choose.
